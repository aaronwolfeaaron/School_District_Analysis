# School_District_Analysis

# Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from a set of high schools in a given school district and to find patterns in math and reading scores and factors associated with higher and lower scores. Furthermore, a refactoring of the data was required after notification from the school board that there may have been false scores reported from a certain school's 9th grade class. This project afforded me the opportunity to analyze data for patterns as well as to correct my findings once discovering that some data values were required to be discarded. 

# Results:
* How is the district summary affected?
